I am a costa rican industrial engineer; but I started my journey as a data scientist some time ago.  
Also, I am part of a growing data science community in Costa Rica; if you want to know more, go to [Grupo DABIA](https://www.grupodabia.com/). 

This site will be hosting ideas, projects and other elements regarding my academic-professional interests, and my journey in life.
